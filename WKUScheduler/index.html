        <p style = "margin-right: 200px; margin-left: 200px">Scheduling classes is stressful. It is one of the most stressful decisions you'll make every semester at Western Kentucky University. What classes conflict with others? How will you decide which classes are the best choice for your college career? What classes will interfere with your job, your studying, and your social life?!<br><br>

        Just breathe. We're here to help.<br><br>

        Now, we can't do everything for you, but we can do some of the work. Once you figure out which classes you want to take, jump over here and we'll show you a visual representation of your classes. You can create a schedule of potential classes, a weekly calendar to give you a better idea on how your week will look, and a map to show you exactly where you'll find your classes on Western Kentucky University's college campus.<br><br>

        We want to help you make good decisions, and we want to make your college career easier, less stressful.<br><br>

        To get started, begin by selecting your potential classes.</p></center>
